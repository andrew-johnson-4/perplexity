# Textual Syntax

The text format for Perplexity ðŸ˜µ is not a dead language.
Usage is loosely grouped by the rank, kind, type, and value of the term.
Beyond those basic four contexts of meaning, everything else can be defined ad-hoc.

| rank       | kind                    |	type    | value
|------------|------------------------------------|---------------|--------------------------
| <img src="/img/black_circle.png" title="black circle" style="height:1em;"/>     | A     | a    | 1 
| <img src="/img/red_line.png" title="red line" style="height:1em;"/>             |	B     | b    | 2
| <img src="/img/triangle_inequality.png" alt="inequality" style="height:1em;"/>  | A->B  | a(b) | {(1,2),(3,4)}

# Visual Syntax

The visual syntax is restricted to colored lines and circles with possible notation associated with each.

# Notes
- Ranks are inhabited by algebras. Kinds are inhabited by judgements. Types are inhabited by terms. Values are inhabited by constants.
