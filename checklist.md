# Checklist for Documenting a Model

1. How many languages/algebras are you going to use in documentation?
> This determines the rank of your model. It is recommended to use different colored lines and circles
> when swapping between languages.
> For example, if you just want to document a TensorFlow model, then you only need Python and your model's rank will be 1.
