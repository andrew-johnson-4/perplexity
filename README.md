The Perplexity ðŸ˜µ language is a notational semantic for documenting neural networks through diagrams.

# Scope
This visual language was created to help document neural networks.
The language may not be suitable to formally describe all characteristics of all possible neural network configurations.

# Format
The Perplexity ðŸ˜µ language consists of two languages: one textual, the other visual. 
The visual language consists of two-dimensional images that can be created in Paint or other visual editors.
